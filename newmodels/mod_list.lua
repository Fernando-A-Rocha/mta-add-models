		-- path can be:
		--		a string, in which case it expects files to be named ID.dff or ID.txd in that folder
		-- 		an array, in which case it expects an array of file names like {dff="filepath.dff", txd="filepath.txd"}
		--
		-- paths defined manually in this file need to be local (this resource)
		-- 		to add a mod from another resource see the examples provided in the documentation.

		-- name can be whatever you want (string)
