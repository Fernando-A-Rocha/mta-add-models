# `Newmodels v6 Red 🟥`

This MTA resource makes use of the clientside allocated models ([engineRequestModel](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/EngineRequestModel) and related features) to add new peds (skins), vehicles and objects:

- there are 3 methods to add new models:
  - [1] place mod files (dff/txd/col files) in designated folders that are automatically scanned
  - [2] place mod files anywhere you want and list them in the mod list lua script
  - [3] dynamically load new models from external resources using exported functions
- the system syncs all added models with all players
- use a simple trick in your existing scripts to work with the new model IDs, or use the provided exported functions
- it's minimalistic, optimized and robust

With this resource you can make scripts or change your existing scripts to add new skin, vehicle and object models to your server! For example, you may add all SA-MP object models!
