# Migrating from previous `Newmodels` versions

This article explains how to migrate from previous versions of newmodels to the newest `Newmodels v6 Red 🟥` version.

## Migrating from v4 and v5

You just need to migrate your model files (dff, txd, col, etc.) to the new `newmodels_red` resource! They will load and work as before.

## Migrating from v3

Migrating from newmodels v3 is now possible, as the system has now evolved with backwards compatibility in mind. However, some breaking changes have been introduced in v6 that you should be aware of.
